Here you will find the code to multiple projects from [ProjectEuler.](https://projecteuler.net/)

Each problem is in it's own directly, and each directory may have the solution in more then one language.

**SPOILER ALERT:** Once I solve a problem, it gets its own file in the directory. If you want to look, go for it, however if you want to solve the problems yourself, I'd recommend staying away.
