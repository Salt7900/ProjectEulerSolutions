Here you will find the code to multiple projects from [ProjectEuler.](https://projecteuler.net/)

Each problem is in it's own directly, and each directory may have the solution in more then one language.

My goals for these are to reinforce skills from languages and to pick up some new ones. Currently I have my eyes set on:
+ Reinforcing *Ruby*
+ Picking up more *Python*
+ Learning a "classic" language, in this case *C++*
+ Working with something from another paradigm, *Clojure*
+ Working with the 2016 StackOverflow favorite, *Rust*

This repo goes hand in hand with the repos from exercism.io, which can all also be found on GitHub.

**SPOILER ALERT:** Once I solve a problem, it gets its own file in the directory. If you want to look, go for it, however if you want to solve the problems yourself, I'd recommend staying away.
